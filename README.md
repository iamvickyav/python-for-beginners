# Lets Begin

I am a Java developer for most of my career. I started learning Python in recent months. This repo is just a recording of all my Python learning

## Python for Java Developers

* Python is a scripting language with support for Object Oriented Programming. In Java, nothing can reside outside the Class. But in Python, there is no such restriction

> Explaning Installation of Python in your system is beyond scope of this document. Please follow instructions give [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Hello World

Learning a Programming language should start with the customary printing of "Hello World". 

Imagine the horrors we gone through while explaining how to write a Hello World Program to a Java Beginner

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```

In Python, its a breeze

```python
print("Hello World");
```

Save the above line in main.py & run the command `python main.py`. Thats it !!!
